# Hypermode Runtime and Plugins

This repository contains the server-side code for the Hypermode Runtime.

It also currently contains the client-side code for Hypermode Plugins,
but that will eventually be moved to a separate repository as the project matures.

## Projects

See the separate `README.md` files in each project for further details:

- [`hmruntime`](./hmruntime) - The Hypermode Runtime service, written in Go
- [`plugins/as`](./plugins/as) - Plugin library and example, written in AssemblyScript
