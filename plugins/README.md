# Hypermode Plugins

This directory contains code for writing Hypermode Plugins in various language.

For now, all plugins are written in [AssemblyScript](https://www.assemblyscript.org/),
and contained in the [`as`](./as) subdirectory.

Eventually it will contain additional subdirectories to support writing plugins
in other languages, such as Go.
